* Simple Recipe Hosting with org-mode
** What this does
The basic usage is like this:
- write recipes in org-mode markup
- run some Python scripts to automatically generate a stylish static
  webpage from them
- host the resulting ~site/~ however you like
  
*** Basic dev workflow with Docker
#+begin_src sh
# generate static content
python3 script/org-to-html.py
python3 script/generate-index.py
# test with local webserver
cd deploy
docker-compose up
#+end_src

I copied a lot of their homework for the site itself, especially for scripting the index page.
