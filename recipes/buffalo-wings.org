* RedHot Buffalo Wings
** Description / Notes
This recipe really whips the llama's ass.

** Ingredients
- cooking oil
- chicken wing segments
- Frank's RedHot "Hot Buffalo" or other wing sauce
*** Dry seasoning
- cornstarch
- cayenne pepper
- Colonel Lee's (or other cajun seasoning salt)
- black pepper
- paprika

** Directions
1. Cut the wings into flats and drummies (if they don't already come that way)
2. Mix the ingredients for the dry seasoning together in a bowl, and
   toss the wings in, coating them with the mix. Put the coated wings
   in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, but ideally for at least 4
   hours or overnight.
3. To cook the wings, start by preheating the oven to 425 degrees Farenheit
4. Take the wings out of the fridge, and coating with cooking
   oil. Line the pan you intend to use with cooking oil, as well.
5. Place the coated wings in the pan, and bake for 20 minutes
6. Remove the wings from the oven and flip each one over, so that it
   gets crispy on both sides. Bake for another 15 minutes.
7. Once the wings are fully crispy, remove from the oven and toss in a
   bowl, coating with buffalo wing sauce of your choosing, and then serve.
