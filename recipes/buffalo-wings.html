<p>This recipe really whips the llama's ass - it's the best I've been
able to get store-bought buffalo wings.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>cooking oil</li>
<li>chicken wing segments</li>
<li>Frank's RedHot "Hot Buffalo" or other wing sauce</li>
<li>cornstarch</li>
<li>cayenne pepper</li>
<li>Colonel Lee's (or other cajun seasoning salt)</li>
<li>black pepper</li>
<li>paprika</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut the wings into flats and drummies (if they don't already come
that way)</li>
<li>Mix the ingredients for the dry seasoning together in a bowl, and
toss the wings in, coating them with the mix. Put the coated wings in
the fridge for at least 30 minutes, but ideally for at least 4 hours or
overnight.</li>
<li>To cook the wings, start by preheating the oven to 425 degrees
Farenheit</li>
<li>Take the wings out of the fridge, and coating with cooking oil. Line
the pan you intend to use with cooking oil, as well.</li>
<li>Place the coated wings in the pan, and bake for 20 minutes</li>
<li>Remove the wings from the oven and flip each one over, so that it
gets crispy on both sides. Bake for another 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Once the wings are fully crispy, remove from the oven and toss in a
bowl, coating with buffalo wing sauce of your choosing, and then
serve.</li>
</ol>
