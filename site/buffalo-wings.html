              <p>
                This method really whips the llama's ass - it's the
                crispiest I've been able to get chicken wings in the
                oven. I do these by just putting the wings in a cast
                iron pan and putting that in to bake, but you can
                probably use a baking sheet with aluminum and get
                similar results (maybe not quite as crispy).

                  <li>
                    Cut the wings into flats and drummies (if they
                    didn't already come that way)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Mix the ingredients for the dry seasoning (starch,
                    pepper, cajun seasoning, black pepper, paprika)
                    together in a bowl, and toss the wings in, coating
                    them with the mix. Put the coated wings in the
                    fridge for at least 30 minutes, but ideally for at
                    least 4 hours or overnight
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To cook the wings, start by preheating the oven to
                    425 degrees Farenheit
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Take the wings out of the fridge, and coating with cooking
                    oil. Line the pan you intend to use with cooking oil, as well.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Place the coated wings in the pan, and bake for 20 minutes
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                    Remove the wings from the oven and flip each one over, so that it
                    gets crispy on both sides. Bake for another 15 minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once the wings are fully crispy, remove from the
                    oven and toss in a bowl, coating with buffalo wing
                    sauce of your choosing, and then serve.
